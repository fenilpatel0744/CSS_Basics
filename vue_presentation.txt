What is Vue.js

Hello everyone, today I’ll be presenting one of the most popular frontend frameworks — Vue.js.
Vue is a progressive JavaScript framework used to build interactive user interfaces and single-page applications.
It was created by Evan You and focuses on being easy to learn, lightweight, and flexible.

why should we use Vue over other frameworks like React or Angular?
Here are some reasons:
Simple Learning Curve – You can start using Vue with just HTML, CSS, and JS knowledge.
Fast Development – Vue is extremely developer-friendly.
Clear Separation of Concerns – Vue provides structure through components, but stays flexible.
Lightweight and Performant – Small in size but fast in execution.
Backed by a strong community and used in many production projects worldwide.

Core Features of Vue.js

Let’s now look at the core features Vue offers:
✅ Component-Based Architecture – Break your UI into small, reusable pieces.
✅ Reactivity – When data changes, your UI updates automatically.
✅ Directives – Like v-if, v-for, and v-model to bind logic to your templates.
✅ Lifecycle Hooks – Control logic at different stages of a component’s life.
✅ Single File Components (.vue files) – Combine HTML, JS, and CSS in one file.
✅ Vue Router – For building single-page applications with multiple views.
✅ Vuex / Pinia – For state management across large applications.
