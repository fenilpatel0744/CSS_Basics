If you are moving any object left to right or right to left then it is in x-axis

If you are moving any object in top to bottom and bottom to top then it is in y-axis

If you are moving any object to ahead or behind then it is z-axis


What is a Z Index?
Z Index (z-index) is a CSS property that defines the order of overlapping HTML elements. 
Elements with a higher index will be placed on top of elements with a lower index.


By default z-index is auto


Can we use z-index without position property?
No, the z-index property only works when the position property is set to a value other than static. 
The position property is used to define how an element is positioned on the page, and it has several 
possible values: static, relative, absolute, fixed, and sticky.


Maximum value of z-index 
The maximum value for the z-index property in CSS is 2147483647. This value represents the maximum positive 
32-bit signed integer in JavaScript, and it is widely supported across modern browsers.


Minimum value of z-index
In CSS, there is no specific minimum value for the z-index property. You can use any integer value, 
including negative numbers, as the z-index value.


Why there is a need of position to use z-index?

It is particularly useful when dealing with overlapping elements on a web page.

ChatGPT
The z-index property is used to control the stacking order of positioned elements, such as elements with position: relative, position: absolute, or position: fixed. The z-index property determines which elements appear in front of or behind other elements when they overlap in the stacking context.

The reason position is required when using z-index is because z-index only applies to positioned elements. By applying a positioning value (position: relative, position: absolute, or position: fixed), you create a new stacking context for the element and allow z-index to have an effect.

When an element has a position value, it establishes a new stacking context with its own layering order. The z-index property then determines the order in which these positioned elements are stacked within their respective stacking contexts.

Without a positioned element, there is no stacking context for z-index to work with, and the property would have no effect. In that case, elements are stacked based on their order in the document structure.

So, to summarize, the position property is required in conjunction with z-index to create a stacking context for positioned elements, allowing you to control their stacking order and determine which elements appear in front of or behind others when they overlap.
