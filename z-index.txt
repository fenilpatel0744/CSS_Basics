If you are moving any object left to right or right to left then it is in x-axis

If you are moving any object in top to bottom and bottom to top then it is in y-axis

If you are moving any object to ahead or behind then it is z-axis


What is a Z Index?
Z Index (z-index) is a CSS property that defines the order of overlapping HTML elements. 
Elements with a higher index will be placed on top of elements with a lower index.


By default z-index is auto


Can we use z-index without position property?
No, the z-index property only works when the position property is set to a value other than static. 
The position property is used to define how an element is positioned on the page, and it has several 
possible values: static, relative, absolute, fixed, and sticky.


Maximum value of z-index 
The maximum value for the z-index property in CSS is 2147483647. This value represents the maximum positive 
32-bit signed integer in JavaScript, and it is widely supported across modern browsers.


Minimum value of z-index
In CSS, there is no specific minimum value for the z-index property. You can use any integer value, 
including negative numbers, as the z-index value.


Why there is a need of position to use z-index?

It is particularly useful when dealing with overlapping elements on a web page.
