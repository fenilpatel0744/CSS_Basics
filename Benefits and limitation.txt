Benefits

Better User Experience
CSS not only makes web pages easy on the eye, it also allows for user-friendly formatting.
When buttons and text are in logical places and well organized, user experience improves.

Quicker Development Time
With CSS, you can apply specific formatting rules and styles to multiple pages with one string of code. 
One cascading style sheet can be replicated across several website pages. 
If, for instance, you have product pages that should all have the same formatting, look, and feel, writing CSS rules for one page will suffice for all pages of that same type.

Easy Formatting Changes
If you need to change the format of a specific set of pages, it’s easy to do so with CSS. 
There’s no need to fix every individual page. Just edit the corresponding CSS stylesheet and you’ll see changes applied to all the pages that are using that style sheet.




Limitation

CSS can have compatibility issues: 
Different web browsers can interpret CSS differently, which can lead to differences in the way a website looks on different browsers. This can make it difficult to ensure that a website looks the same on all browsers.
