Flexbox Layout (Flexible Box) 

The main idea behind the flex layout is to give the container the ability to alter its itemsâ€™ width/height 
(and order) to best fill the available space (mostly to accommodate to all kind of display devices and screen 
sizes). A flex container expands items to fill available free space or shrinks them to prevent overflow.


Is it necessary to declare parent element in flex box?
Yes, it is necessary to declare the parent element as a flex container in order to use flexbox. 
The parent element acts as the container for the flex items and is responsible for establishing the flex 
formatting context.


Need of flexbox?
It allows you to easily control the positioning and alignment of elements within a container, 
both horizontally and vertically, without relying on floats, positioning, or table layouts.

Flexbox focuses on one-dimensional layouts, either in a row or column. This makes it perfect for organizing 
elements along a single axis, whether it's horizontally or vertically. It offers control over the 
distribution of available space and the alignment of items within that axis.


Main Axes
The direction of the main axis is determined by the flex-direction property set on the container. 
By default, the main axis runs horizontally from left to right
Properties like justify-content and align-items are applied along the main axis to define the alignment 
and spacing of items in that direction.


Cross Axes
Properties like align-items and align-self are applied along the cross axis to specify how flex items should 
align vertically


flex-direction by default row


Use align-items when you want to vertically align flex items within the flex container. 


Order is big than it comes at last position


The flex-grow property in CSS flexbox is used to control how flex items grow and distribute available space 
along the main axis of the flex container when there is extra space available. It specifies the proportion 
of the available space that each flex item should take up.

The flex-grow property accepts a unitless value, which represents the flex grow factor. 
This factor determines how much each flex item should grow relative to the other items. 
By default, the value is set to 0, meaning the item does not grow and will only take up the space it needs 
based on its content.
