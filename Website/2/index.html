            HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used to design web
            pages using a markup language. HTML is the combination of Hypertext
            and Markup language. Hypertext defines the link between web pages. A
            markup language is used to define the text document within the tag
            which defines the structure of web pages. This language is used to
            annotate (make notes for the computer) text so that a machine can
            understand it and manipulate text accordingly. Most markup languages
            (e.g. HTML) are human-readable. The language uses tags to define
            what manipulation has to be done on the text. HTML is a markup
            language used by the browser to manipulate text, images, and other
            content, in order to display it in the required format.

          <p>
            Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simply
            designed language intended to simplify the process of making web
            pages presentable. CSS allows you to apply styles to web pages. More
            importantly, CSS enables you to do this independent of the HTML that
            makes up each web page. It describes how a webpage should look: it
            prescribes colors, fonts, spacing, and much more. In short, you can
            make your website look however you want. CSS lets developers and
            designers define how it behaves, including how elements are
            positioned in the browser. While html uses tags, css uses rulesets.
            CSS is easy to learn and understand, but it provides powerful
            control over the presentation of an HTML document.

            JavaScript is a lightweight, cross-platform, and interpreted
            compiled programming language which is also known as the scripting
            language for webpages. It is well-known for the development of web
            pages, many non-browser environments also use it. JavaScript can be
            used for Client-side developments as well as Server-side
            developments. Javascript is both imperative and declarative type of
            language. JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, like
            Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements like
            operators, control structures, and statements.
