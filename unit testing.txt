Unit testing

what is it 
and why

for react what is the pre requisite
jest and react testing library 

what is the jest and use of it
Jest is a Javascript testing library(not only for React, but for any JS related framework or library).
Jest is a test runner and is responsible for
Finding Tests
Running the tests
Determining whether the tests pass or fail

what is the react testing library and what is the use of it
Provides virtual DOMs for tests - Any time we are running tests without a browser, 
we need to have a virtual DOM so we can do things like click elements and we can see 
if virtual DOM behaves like it should do (like changing colour of a div on a button click and so on)

what is the difference between jest and react testing library

what is the jest dom 

what is the difference between jest and jest dom

which are the function used for testing

what are the matchers and how to use it 

what are the queries and how to use it

and then example 

mock example - after use of axios
 SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module
 
 What is the use of transformIgnorePatterns?
The transformIgnorePatterns option can be used to whitelist or blacklist files from being transformed 
with babel.

Difference betweetn test and it

They do the same thing, but their names are different and with that their interaction with the name 
of the test.

test

What you write:

describe('yourModule', () => {
  test('if it does this thing', () => {});
  test('if it does the other thing', () => {});
});
What you get if something fails:

yourModule > if it does this thing
it

What you write:

describe('yourModule', () => {
  it('should do this thing', () => {});
  it('should do the other thing', () => {});
});
What you get if something fails:

yourModule > should do this thing
So it's about readability not about functionality.

In my opinion, it really has a point when it comes to read the result of a failing test that 
you haven't written yourself. It helps to faster understand what the test is about.

Some developer also shorten the Should do this thing to Does this thing which is a bit shorter and 
also fits semantically to the it notation.


Difference between userEvent and fireEvent
Let's say I have to click on button, so what procedures for that 
mouse hover
mouse move
mouse down
focus
mouse up
click

so this all done in userEvent but in fireEvent only click is called directly

fireEvent neglects the other related events but userEvent execute all the events like what actually
happens in the browser

we are rendering the page in beforeAll function but after each test the cleanup function call 
automatic by jest which do the Unmounts React trees that were mounted with render, so after that there
is no render is possible if we are using beforeAll because it calls once at starting, so for that we 
need to stop the cleanup function for that we can use @testing-library/react/pure,
