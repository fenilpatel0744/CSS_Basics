linear gradient is a graphical representation of a smooth transition between two or more colors.

linear-gradient() function as a value for properties like background-image or background

few as two colors, and there is no strict maximum limit on the number of colors you can use.

by default top to bottom


In repeating linear gradients, specifying percentages is optional, but it can be useful for creating precise and controlled repeating patterns.

The repeating-linear-gradient() function in CSS allows you to create a linear gradient that repeats at regular intervals. It takes the same parameters as the linear-gradient() function, including the direction and color stops.

Here's an example of a repeating linear gradient without using percentages:


.selector {
  background-image: repeating-linear-gradient(red, blue);
}
In this case, the linear gradient will repeat indefinitely without any specific measurement or positioning information. The browser will automatically repeat the gradient to fill the available space.

However, if you want more control over the repetition and the size of each repeated segment, you can use percentages in the color stops. This allows you to define the size of each repeated section based on percentages of the container's width or height.

Here's an example using percentages:

.selector {
  background-image: repeating-linear-gradient(to right, red 0%, blue 50%);
}
In this case, the gradient starts with red at 0% of the container's width and transitions to blue at 50% of the container's width. The gradient will repeat from there onward.

By using percentages, you can create more precise and predictable repeating patterns with linear gradients.

So, while percentages are not required in repeating linear gradients, they can be beneficial in controlling the size and positioning of each repeated segment.
